This document describes a simple HTTP state management mechanism, called cake, that lets HTTP servers maintain stateful sessions with HTTP user agents. This mechanism is harmonized with the same-origin security model and provides both confidentiality and integrity protection against active network attackers. In addition, the mechanism is robust to cross-site request forgery attacks.Editorial Note (To be removed by RFC Editor) If you have suggestions for improving this document, please send email to <mailto:http-state@ietf.org>.
