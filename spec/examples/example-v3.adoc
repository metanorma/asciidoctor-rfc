[abstract]
Avian carriers can provide high delay, low throughput, and low
altitude service.  The connection topology is limited to a single
point-to-point path for each carrier, used with standard carriers,
but many carriers can be used without significant interference with
each other, outside of early spring.  This is because of the 3D ether
space available to the carriers, in contrast to the 1D ether used by
IEEE802.3.  The carriers have an intrinsic collision avoidance
system, which increases availability.  Unlike some network
technologies, such as packet radio, communication is not limited to
line-of-sight distance.  Connection oriented service is available in
some cities, usually based upon a central hub topology.

NOTE: Yes, this is an April Fool's RFC.

== Frame Format

The IP _datagram_ is *printed*, on a small scroll of paper, in
hexadecimal, with each octet separated by whitestuff and blackstuff.
The scroll of paper is wrapped around one leg of the avian carrier.
A band of duct tape is used to secure the datagram's edges.  The
bandwidth is limited to the leg length.  The MTU is variable, and
paradoxically, generally increases with increased carrier age.  A
typical MTU is 256 milligrams.  Some datagram padding may be needed.<<gof,2>>

Upon receipt, the duct tape is removed and the paper copy of the
datagram is optically scanned into a electronically transmittable
form.<<xxx>>

This document extends OpenPGP and its ECC extension to support SM2, SM3 and SM4:

* support the SM3 hash algorithm for data validation purposes
* support signatures utilizing the combination of SM3 with other digital
  signing algorithms, such as RSA, ECDSA and SM2
* support the SM2 asymmetric encryption algorithm for public key
  operations
* support usage of SM2 in combination with supported hash algorithms, such as
  SHA-256 and SM3
* support the SM4 symmetric encryption algorithm for data protection purposes
* defines the OpenPGP profile "OSCCA-SM234" to enable usage of OpenPGP
  in an OSCCA-compliant manner.

Algorithm-Specific Fields for SM2DSA keys:

* a variable-length field containing a curve OID, formatted
  as follows:
.. a one-octet size of the following field; values 0 and
   0xFF are reserved for future extensions
.. octets representing a curve OID.
*  MPI of an EC point representing a public key

== Supported Algorithms

=== Public Key Algorithms

The SM2 algorithm is supported with the following extension.

NOTE: ECDH is defined in Section 8 of this document.

The following public key algorithm IDs are added to expand Section
9.1 of RFC4880, "Public-Key Algorithms":

== Security Considerations

Security is not generally a problem in normal operation, but special +
measures [bcp14]#MUST# be taken (such as data encryption) when avian carriers
are used in a tactical environment.<<pp>>
